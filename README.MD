Like other Randomizers, the **Twilight Princess Randomizer** (TPR) shuffles the contents of chests and other collectibles, thus bringing new life to a classic game. It also adds a bunch of Quality of Life changes to make gameplay even smoother! Some crucial changes are:
* Fast Climbing (Ladders, Vines)
* Bigger wallets (100/5000/9999)
* More skippable cutscenes
* Epona will automatically be tamed
* Boring gameplay skips (planned to be optional)
